# CNN_DataMining

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks. 
They’re most commonly used to analyse visual imagery and are frequently working behind the scenes in image classification. They can be found at the core of everything from Facebook’s photo tagging to self-driving cars. They’re working hard behind the scenes in everything from healthcare to security.

Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “car”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a car”).

CNNs actually use very little preprocessing. This means that they can learn the filters that have to be hand-made in other algorithms. CNNs can be used in tons of applications from image and video recognition, image classification, and recommender systems to natural language processing and medical image analysis.

So ill be using the Dataset Cars and Trucks where we have to use image classification to distinguish cars vs trucks images.

Ill be using Google’s free deep learning cloud notebook
# Colab notebook ( https://colab.research.google.com/ ) for this classification.

The dataset ill be using cars vs trucks dataset 
Cars dataset from below

And Trucks dataset from kaggle
